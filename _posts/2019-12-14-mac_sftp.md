If you use MacOS, the default `sftp` binary does not work will when you access a Linux server --
arrow keys print stuff like `^[[A`, and command history does not work either.

[This post](https://superuser.com/questions/176340/command-line-history-tab-completion-for-sftp-in-os-x-terminal-app)
suggests that MacOS's `sftp` is not build with readline support. readline is a utility that handles command history, arrow
keys etc.

You can get a better version of `sftp` through [Homerew](https://brew.sh): `brew install openssh`. If `sftp` still doesn't
behave properly, make sure you address issues pointed out by `brew doctor`, and open a new terminal.
